<li>In the veterinary field there are many things you can special in. The everyday life there can be pretty eventful. They could have simple puppy shots come in or a dog that could've been hit by a car.  </li>

<h2><span class="heada">The Tour</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>As we all sat there quitly the guy told us about his life. We heard about what he does and how it all got started. Some people listened and others didnt. Some people stared off into the back of their eye lids. (Melvin) As he told us everything, we asked him questions and took a group picture. After we took the picture, we got a tour. </li>

<h2><span class="heada">The Ride Back</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>On the ride back we were squished. I think our bus driver was a little wack. We spent $5 on milkshakes and she came and took them all. People in the back of the bus got to the point to where we put our drinks in our shirts. I may not be broke but i dont waste $5 on just anything.</li>
